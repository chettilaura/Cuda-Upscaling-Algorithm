\section*{Abstract}

In this document an upscaling algorithm in CUDA has been implemented: it is a technique used to produce an enlarged picture from a given digital image while correcting the visual artifacts originated from the zooming process.

The zooming algorithm works on RGB images in PPM format:
it provides as output a zoomed picture, cut-out from the original one passed through the command line, while simultaneously correcting its aliased behavior by implementing a convolution with a specific filter.

The user needs to set, through the command line, the RGB picture that has to be zoomed, the coordinates of the center of the selection zone and the side lengths of the selection mask.
It is also left to the user to specify the filter to be applied in the convolution: it's both possible to load a custom kernel or create a Gaussian filter specifying its length and standard deviation.
