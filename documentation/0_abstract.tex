\section*{Abstract}

In this document we implement an upscaling algorithm in CUDA: It is a technique used to produce an enlarged picture from a given digital image while correcting the visual artifacts originated in the zooming process.

Our zooming algorithm works on RGB images in PPM format:
it provides as output a zoomed picture, cut out from the original one passed through the command line, while simultaneously correcting its aliased behavior by implementing a convolution with a specific filter.

The user needs to set, through the command line, the RGB picture that has to be zoomed, the coordinates of the center of the selection zone and the side length of the selection mask which has a square odd shape.
It is also left to the user to specify the filter to be applied in the convolution: it's both possible to set out a custom kernel or to create a Gaussian filter specifying its length and $\Sigma$.
