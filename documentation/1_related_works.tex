    \subsection{The Pixel Replication Algorithm}
    In our implementation of the zooming algorithm we develop the gpu version of the already existing algorithm 
    named “Pixel replication” also known as the “Nearest neighbor interpolation”.\\
    As its name suggests, it replicates the neighboring pixels in order to increase them to enlarge the image: it creates new pixels from the already given ones.\\
    In this method each pixel is replicated n times row wise and column wise: therefore the size of the final image corresponds to (…) \\
    This Algorithm has the advantage of being a very simple technique of implementing the zooming technique but, 
    on the other hand, as the zooming factor increased the resulting image gets more blurred.

    \subsection{Image Filtering Convolution Algorithm}
    In order to implement the convolution of the zoomed image, with a specified filter, 
    we had to manipulate the already known version of the “Image filtering through convolution” Algorithm.
    In the original implementation of the algorithm ..
